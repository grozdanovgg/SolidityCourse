The contract creates a contract for each of its members. This is highly inefficient and can be replaced with a library, where the member data is stored in our main contract.

The problems using a Member contract is that we have to call it to get the state (member data), which is returned as a set of 3 variables and not as a structure, because external calls do not support structures. The "donated" function is also expensive, because it requires an expensive external call to change just one variable.

Lines 43-46 initialize a structure line-by-line, whereas it can be initialized on a single line

The array "memberList" is unneeded.

The state variables tmp1, tmp2, tmp3 are only used locally in a modifier and therefore should be defined locally.
